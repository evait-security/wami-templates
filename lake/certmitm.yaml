description: CertMitm is a security testing tool primarily used for assessing the certificate validation vulnerabilities of TLS connections. It is exceptionally useful when identifying vulnerabilities made by a client device or an application. Its strength lies in evaluating TLS handshake process, enabling correct validation protocol, testing for MITM attacks and penetration testing applications.
