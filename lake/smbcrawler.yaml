  SmbCrawler is no-nonsense tool that takes credentials and a list of hosts
  and 'crawls' (or 'spiders') through those shares. Features include
  taking host names, IP addresses, IP ranges, or an nmap XML file as input,
  checks permissions (check for 'write' permissions is opt-in, because it
  requires creating an empty directory on the share), customizable crawling
  depth, outputs results in machine-readable formats or as an interactive
  HTML report, pass-the-hash support, auto-download of interesting files,
  reporting potential secrets, threaded, pausable, and interactively skip
  single shares and hosts. Installation requirements and instructions are
  detailed as well.
