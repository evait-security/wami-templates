description: SmbCrawler is a practical network analysis tool that accepts credentials and a list of hosts and navigates (or 'spiders') through those shares. Its core features include receiving various input types ranging from host names, IP addresses, IP ranges, or an nmap xml file, checking permissions, customizable crawling depth, outputting results in machine-readable formats or as an interactive HTML report, pass-the-hash support, auto-downloading of interesting files, reporting potential secrets, pausing operations, interactive skipping of single shares and hosts.
