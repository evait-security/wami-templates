description: "smbcrawler is a no-nonsense tool that takes credentials and a list of hosts and 'crawls' (or 'spiders') through those shares. It takes host names, IP addresses, IP ranges, or an nmap xml file as input and checks permissions. The tool's crawling depth is customizable and outputs results in machine-readable formats or as an interactive HTML report. It also features pass-the-hash support, auto-download for interesting files, reports potential secrets, and is threaded and pausable. One can interactively skip single shares and hosts. Installation requires having usage of pipx and may involve compiling dependencies from the source."
