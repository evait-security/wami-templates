description: 'SmbCrawler is a straightforward tool that takes credentials and a list of hosts and crawls, or spiders, through those shares. It processes host names, IP addresses, IP ranges, or an nmap xml file as input. Features include permissions check, customizable crawling depth, result output in machine-readable formats or interactive HTML report, pass-the-hash support, auto-download interesting files, potential secrets report, threading, pausability, and interactive skipping of single shares and hosts. Installation requires Python package and compilation of the poppler C++ headers during installation when building the package from source.'
