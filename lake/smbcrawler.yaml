description: SmbCrawler is a no-nonsense tool that takes credentials and a list of hosts and 'crawls' or 'spiders' through those shares. Key features include the ability to take host names, IP addresses, IP ranges, or an nmap xml file as input, and it checks permissions. Other features include customizable crawling depth, outputting results in machine-readable formats or as an interactive HTML report, pass-the-hash support, auto-download interesting files, report potential secrets, it's threaded, pausable, and you can interactively skip single shares and hosts.
