description: SmbCrawler is a strong, straightforward tool designed to accept credentials and a host list as its inputs and to reliably crawl or spider through the involved shares. It allows for enhancements like checking permissions (with 'write' permissions given the green light only when opted in, considering creating an empty directory on the share is required for it), customization of crawling depth, and outputting results in machine-readable formats or as an HTML report that enables interactive usage. SmbCrawler also supports pass-the-hash, auto-downloading of intriguing files, reporting potential secrets, and is threaded, pausable, and enables interactive skipping of individual shares and hosts.
