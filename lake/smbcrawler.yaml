description: SmbCrawler is a no-nonsense tool that takes credentials and a list of hosts and crawls or spiders through those shares. It takes hostnames, IP addresses, IP ranges, or an nmap xml file as input while checking permissions. The crawling depth is customizable and results are output in machine-readable formats or as an interactive HTML report. It has interactive features for skipping single hosts or shares, and thoroughly checks for potential secrets with pass-the-hash support.
