description: RustHound is a cross-platform BloodHound collector tool written in Rust, making it compatible with Linux, Windows, and macOS. No AV detection and cross-compiled. RustHound generates users, groups, computers, OUs, GPOs, containers, and domain JSON files that can be analyzed with BloodHound. If you can use SharpHound, use it. Use RustHound as a backup solution if SharpHound is detected by AV or if it not compatible with your OS.
