description: I wrote Albatar to have a neat and tidy tool to exploit SQL injection vulnerabilities. Unlike sqlmap, Albatar will not detect SQL injection vulnerabilities, it is primarily designed to help exploit not-so-straightforward injections where sqlmap would need tweaking and patching to work. Albatar is a framework in Python. As a result, you need to write some Python code to be able to exploit the SQLI. Then simply invoke your script by passing sqlmap-like command line options (like --dbs, --banner etc.) to retrieve data from the database. Currently, Albatar supports MySQL, MSSQL and Oracle with the Union, Error, Boolean and Time techniques.
