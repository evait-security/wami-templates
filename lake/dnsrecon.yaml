description: DNSRecon is a Python port of a Ruby script that I wrote to learn the language and about DNS in early 2007. This time I wanted to learn about Python and extend the functionality of the original tool and in the process re-learn how DNS works and how could it be used in the process of a security assessment and network troubleshooting.
