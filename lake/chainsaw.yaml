description: Chainsaw provides a powerful first-response capability to quickly identify threats within Windows forensic artefacts such as Event Logs and MFTs. Chainsaw offers a generic and fast method of searching through event logs for keywords, and by identifying threats using built-in support for Sigma detection rules, and via custom Chainsaw detection rules.
