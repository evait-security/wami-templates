description: Arjun can find query parameters for URL endpoints. If you don't get what that means, it's okay, read along. Web applications use parameters (or queries) to accept user input, take the following example into consideration http://api.example.com/v1/userinfo?id=751634589 This URL seems to load user information for a specific user id, but what if there exists a parameter named admin which when set to True makes the endpoint provide more information about the user? This is what Arjun does, it finds valid HTTP parameters with a huge default dictionary of 25,890 parameter names. The best part? It takes less than 10 seconds to go through this huge list while making just 50-60 requests to the target
