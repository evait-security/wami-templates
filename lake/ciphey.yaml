description: Ciphey is a fully automated decryption/decoding/cracking tool using natural language processing & artificial intelligence. It can decrypt text without knowing the key or cipher, decode encodings, and crack hashes. It uses a custom built artificial intelligence module (AuSearch) with a Cipher Detection Interface to approximate what something is encrypted with, and a custom-built natural language processing Language Checker Interface, which can detect when the given text becomes plaintext.
