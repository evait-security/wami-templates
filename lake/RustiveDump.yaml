description: |
  RustiveDump is a Rust-based tool created to dump the memory of the lsass.exe process using only NT system calls. It generates a minimal minidump file containing essential components. It supports XOR encryption and remote transmission. It can also be compiled as Position Independent Code (PIC). The tool provides detailed logs of each step when the debug mode is enabled. The dump file can be sent directly to a remote server using winsock API calls. RustiveDump offers several configurable build options through cargo make for features like XOR encryption, remote file transmission, and verbose logging. The Repository should be used responsibly, and any misuse is not condoned by the author.
