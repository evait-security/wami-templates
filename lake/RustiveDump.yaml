description: "RustiveDump is a Rust-based tool designed to dump the memory of the lsass.exe process using only NT system calls. It creates a minimal minidump file from scratch, providing key components like SystemInfo, ModuleList, and Memory64List. The tool also supports XOR encryption, remote file transmission, and can be compiled as Position Independent Code (PIC), improving its versatility. The project is built as a personal learning journey on leveraging native Windows APIs for memory dumping and constructing a minimalist minidump file from ground zero."
