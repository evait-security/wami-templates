description: >
  RustiveDump is a Rust-based tool designed specifically to dump the memory of the lsass.exe 
  process using only NT system calls. It generates a minimal minidump file from beginning, 
  encapsulating key components like SystemInfo, ModuleList, and Memory64List. The tool supports 
  XOR encryption and remote file transmission, providing a versatile set of features. Apart from 
  the core functionality, RustiveDump incorporates the architecture of Rustic64, allowing it 
  to be compiled as Position Independent Code (PIC). This project has been a personal learning 
  adventure, aimed at exploiting native Windows APIs for memory dumping, and constructing a 
  minimalistic minidump file entirely from scratch.

  Key Features:

  1. NT System Calls for Everything: RustiveDump bypasses conventional APIs and employs 
     NT system calls for all its functions.
  2. No-Std and CRT-Independent:  RustiveDump is coded using Rust's feature, removing 
     any dependency on the standard library and CRT.
