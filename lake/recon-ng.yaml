description: Recon-ng is an Open Source Intelligence gathering tool aimed at reducing the time spent harvesting information from open sources. It provides a full-featured reconnaissance framework designed for conducting open source web-based reconnaissance in a thorough and efficient manner. Modeled after Metasploit Framework to keep the learning curve minimal, Recon-ng is highly modular and ideal for both novice and experienced Python developers.
why_not: Metasploit Framework for exploitation, Social-Engineer Toolkit for social engineering tasks.
